When performing our temporal analysis, why cant we simply search the parquet file for all entries with the desired county name?
The parquet file stores county ID's, so the desired county ID must be derived from the county dataset first
The parquet file type doesnt allow querying by row
The parquet file doesnt contain any county data, so we must do a spatial join first
